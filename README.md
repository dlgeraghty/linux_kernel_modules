# linux_kernel_modules
code for linux kernel modules for learning purposes

## Readme file usage:
The readme file takes in a parameter, the module you want to build, this is specified the following way:
```
make alll file=hello_world
```
That way we can reuse the makefile for all the other modules without having to change it every time...(its all about optimization)
